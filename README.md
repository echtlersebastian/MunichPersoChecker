# PersoChecker 
This is a Service that checks if your Personalausweis is ready to get picked up at the Bürgerbüro in Munich. You can Subscribe at the Website and than get hopefully notified, when the state of your Personalausweis changes.🤩



# Why do the World need something like this?
The Guy at the counter in 🤡Bürgerbüro🤡 was telling me, that i will not get any notification about the status of my personalausweis. He said: "just check the website
mentioned on the printed Abholschein and type in your Ausweisnummer. It is working like the Package Tracking at DHL". But it does not work like DHL. Because i get 
notified about my packages at DHL. And i am that kind of guy, that forgets about an Personalausweis and will never Pick it up from the 🤡Bürgerbüro🤡. Thats why i wrote 
this Service. Now everybody is able to recieve an Email, as soon, as the Personalausweis is ready to be picked up. 🎉


# What it does:
 - Enter your E-Mail and your ausweisnummer
 - it will get stored in a Database. Once a day a GitHub Action will trigger and do the following:
 - Checks every record with a Selenium Test by opening the Website muenchen.de/pass and entering the Ausweisnummer.
 - Checks if the status is "kann noch nicht abgeholt werden". 
 - If yes, nothing will happen, beause we need to wait longer. 
 - If no, the Status has changed and and email will be send out to the specific mailadress.
 - After the Mail is sent, the E-Mail and the Ausweisnummer will be *deleted* in the Database!
 - The Check runs once a day (i think, that higher frequent executions will just break the Internet at Bürgerbüro 🤡)
